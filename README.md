# EIP4788-Experiments
EIP4788-Experiments is an experimental testing ground for exploring the capabilities and applications of EIP-4788 in Ethereum's post-merge architecture. This repository contains multiple small proof-of-concept (PoC) projects that demonstrate different ways to leverage Beacon Chain data in smart contracts.


## Experiments

1. **BeaconVerifier**: Verify validator status (active/inactive)
2. **ValidatorRewards**: Track and verify validator rewards
3. **NetworkHealth**: Monitor overall network health metrics
4. **SlashingDetector**: Detect and verify slashing events
5. **AttestationPerformance**: Verify validator attestation performance



## Running Experiments

Each experiment is self-contained within its contract, script, and test files. To run an experiment:

1. Deploy the relevant contract
2. Use the corresponding script to generate proofs or fetch data
3. Interact with the contract using the web interface or directly through Hardhat
